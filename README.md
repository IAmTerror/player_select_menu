Player Select Menu is a personal project aiming at implement the Player Select Menu from the video game Street Fighter II Turbo : Hyper Fighting (SNES / Super Nintendo / Super Famicom) in Lua programming language + LÖVE (Love2d) framework.

## Potential improvements

* management of alternative costumes for each character
* selector flicker implementation (with shaders ?)
* the little plane... :heart_eyes: and the nightmarish implementation of the coordinates... :sob:
* implementation of the entire pre-game sequence : editor's logo, start menu, presentation of the two selected characters...
